                                    <p id="reviewDescription">Here there is a good color usage, with only 2 main colors it provides a pop and depth. It makes it less bland when the letters are red especially with the font style that makes the letters seem sanded. The positioning
                                        with each section in a different row or column that are not aligned gives it a feeling of having volume without it being too overwhelming.</p>

                                    <p id="reviewDescription">There is a lot of symbols and images to represent words and this could be too much complexity for some viewers. Some people might not understand or will understand this differently than wanted.</p>

                                    <p id="reviewDescription">This work section has a carousel class going through each work experience. It was a good idea to have both an image and the description in the carousel, having it split between them. And I liked the smaller faded pictures
                                        under the carousel that acted as buttons, as it also lets you know where you wanted to go back to on the carousel. The shading gives depth between the container and the wrapper making the container seem to pop out,
                                        and the intricate design in the background makes the whole background not feel bland yet very lightly colored so not to be a distraction. </p>

                                    <p id="reviewDescription">Nice bright portfolio, Jim's profile section has a nice short description of himself. The use of entities next to the words gives a stronger feeling to the word which invokes more emotions in the person who sees this
                                        which is very useful. The pastel red color dividing lines give a brightness to the portfolio in comparison to the black colored words.</p>

                                    <p id="reviewDescription">These characteristics or short peeks into Jim's are not very useful in finding out about his capabilities, and instead; seems quite immature to write on a portfolio.</p>

                                        photo and description of himself in that fixed left column always being in view was a good idea, because the person examining the project will be able to associate all this work again with the person allowing him
                                        to be remembered.</p>

                                        different parts like the name of the company, the place and year of work, and description. Each part being a different color gives a good contrast and ability to quickly notice while scanning the portfolio so more

                                    <p id="reviewDescription">Very creative idea to use stars as a description of their mastery of the skill, and the fact that it uses stars makes it feel like each skill even if it has only one or two stars near the end of the list may still be
                                        useful or still have growth capacity. It's nice that the stars and the section headings have the same color, makes it feel like it flows down the page as well.</p>
                                    <h4 id="imageCpt">Criticisms:</h4>
                                    <p id="reviewDescription">The font Pascal used was very thin and against the white background is easily painful on the eyes. The font should have thicker or larger font.</p>

                                    <p id="reviewDescription">The navbar on the right side being fixed and moving along while scrolling is very neat and adds to the intricacy of the website while keeping it simple. When hovering over these projects it also provides a short and
                                        simple title, description, and even gives tags of the project. The tags in this short overview I think is very useful in giving even more of a widescope of information on the project in simple wording.</p>
